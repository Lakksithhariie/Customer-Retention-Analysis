The project focuses on analyzing customer churn and risk factors for a telecommunications company, offering insights into customer behavior and service usage. Key metrics reveal that 7,043 customers are at risk of churning, with fiber optic services experiencing the highest churn rate at 44%. Electronic checks are the most common payment method among these customers. Visual data includes graphs showing higher churn rates for month-to-month contracts and charts detailing customer demographics and the services they subscribe to, such as phone service and streaming. This project demonstrates the use of data visualization to gain strategic insights in business contexts.
